# Progress of the Philippines' Sustainable Development Goals: An Open-Source Dataset
In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly created 17 interlinked global goals that
was intended to be achieved by 2030. It was said that it would pave the way to "a better and more sustainable future for all". The interlinked global goals was named the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).

These goals were embraced by all member states of the United Nations, which includes the Philippines, as they believe that these goals would bring prosperity not only to their citizens but to the whole planet. The creation of these goals recognizes that to end poverty, other problems must also be addressed. These problems include improving the health and education system and reducing all forms of inequalities. 

In this notebook, 27 different datasets from the Philippine Statistics Authority, the government agency assigned to update the Philippine's data on this goals, would be combined. Fifteen (15) of these datasets are directly about the SDG, while others are indirectly connected to the SDGs.

## Why is this dataset needed?

## Scope of this dataset
The open-sourced dataset—the Progress of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the Philippines—was a result of scouring the official open data platform of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the OpenSTAT.

As one of the dataset’s goals was to help determine what goals each region in the Philippines needs to focus on, the type of datasets that were searched for was datasets regarding SDGs that were divided per region per year. However, as OpenSTAT only contains data for the Philippines as a whole (for datasets that are for the targets of the SDGs) two divisions of the PSA have been contacted: the Knowledge Management and Communications Division and the SDG division. 

This implies that if the PSA did not collect or release the target for a specific SDG per region, this dataset cannot include these as there are no official data.
Through this, fourteen datasets, which correspond to one target each, were received and collated. Although the SDG was only formally established in 2015, some of the datasets started as far back as 2001.

Thus, these datasets only include data for the regions of the Philippines and Philippines as a whole. The years differs for some of the columns, but the total range is from 2000 to 2021.
